# C++ Module: Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operator Overloading, and Orthodox Canonical Class Form

## Overview

In this module, we delve into three important concepts in C++ programming: **ad-hoc polymorphism**, **operator overloading**, and the **Orthodox Canonical class form**. These topics enhance your ability to write more flexible, efficient, and maintainable code in C++. By the end of this module, you will be comfortable with polymorphism in C++, customizing operators to work with your classes, and adhering to the best practices for defining classes.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Ad-hoc Polymorphism**
- Understanding **ad-hoc polymorphism** and how it differs from other types of polymorphism.
- Using **function overloading** to implement ad-hoc polymorphism. This allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
- Demonstrating **template overloading** and function specialization as forms of ad-hoc polymorphism.
- Practical examples to show how ad-hoc polymorphism enhances flexibility and reduces function duplication.

### 2. **Operator Overloading**
- Introduction to **operator overloading** and why it's essential for creating more expressive and user-friendly code.
- How to overload operators like `+`, `-`, `=`, `[]`, `()`, and others to work with your custom classes.
- Best practices for operator overloading, including considerations for symmetry, consistency, and efficiency.
- Example of a `ComplexNumber` class where operators are overloaded for adding, subtracting, and comparing complex numbers.

### 3. **Orthodox Canonical Class Form**
- Understanding the **Orthodox Canonical Form** (OCF) in C++ and its importance in class design.
- Explanation of the **big three**: the **copy constructor**, the **copy assignment operator**, and the **destructor**.
- How to implement these functions properly to ensure the correct behavior of objects when copied or assigned.
- Best practices for handling resources such as dynamic memory and managing resource ownership.
